# Polar Sorting Visualizer

This project helps to visualize sorting algorithms with the use of a polar coordinate system rather than the traditional cartesian coordinates. In this system we sort elements, represented as lines, across increasing angles along the Î˜-axis (think sorting across increasing integers along the x-axis in the cartesian-system) based on their radius or the R-value they reach (think height or the y-value they reach in the cartesian-system).
